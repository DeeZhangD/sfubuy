Major features (implemented): 
So far, we have implemented the basic user system, and simple user interface of login, create account, 
and welcome page. The login system will not change in the future, but we may improve the design of user 
interface.

1.	Information database: We set up a database to manage the information of manager and users of our 
	webpage. These two includes the essential information for manager and user account, like name, 
	password, email, phone number ect. 
2.	User log in system: If user do not have an account, they need to first create one, and the new 
	account will be recorded in the database. User can not create manager account. Then user can login 
	their account by input user name and password. The system will match the input information in the 
	database, and will output message for error matching. In addition, user can click their profile to enter 
	the user center, in here, they can check their own information.
3.	Verify code: verify code is to prevent the robot account. We think it is useful to protect and manage our
	 web.
